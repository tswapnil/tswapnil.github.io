## Welcome to Swapnil Taneja's page

   I am a software engineer at Snowflake Computing. I have done my Masters in CSE from UCSD. I have interned at Twitter and worked at Oracle . My research interests lie in the field of Databases and Machine Learning at scale. I like to create and build distributed software that runs on cloud. I primarly code distributed software in Java and Python.  
   
- Riddle me this - 
   Voiceless it cries,
   Wingless flutters,
   Toothless bites,
   Mouthless mutters.

### Projects and Research
- **AI team at UCSD**
  Worked on a Q-learning control RL algorithm with guidance from Prof. Sicun Gao at UCSD . 
  
- **SAT Solver – Automated Reasoning in AI**
  Wrote a custom SAT Solver by implementing DPLL and CDCL algorithms. C++. [Link](https://github.com/tswapnil/SAT-Solver)
  
- **Stance Detection on News Articles** 
  Worked on aligning headlines and articles by extracting textual and similarity based features. [Report](https://github.com/tswapnil/Resume/blob/master/stance-detection-news.pdf) 
  Impact: Achieved 92% accuracy with a SVM classifier and a Multi Layered Perceptron. 
 
- **Sign and Link Prediction on Signed Social Networks – Graph Mining**                 
  Built models and extracted features such as Jaccard’s Similarity, Social Imbalance, User’s reputation, Community Detection and    Restricted Boltzmann Machines on Slashdot Dataset. [Report](https://github.com/tswapnil/Resume/blob/master/link-sign-prediction.pdf) ML - Python 
 Impact: Achieved 91 % F1 score for link prediction and 85.9 % for sign prediction accuracy. 
 
- **Capacitive fabric touch controlled Sphero SPRK+ – Healthcare Robotics**
  Built a system to assist growth of infants with hardware restrictions. Kids with hardware restrictions may face flat head syndrome if they do not receive plenty tummy time. This system acts as a playmat for them and captures their attention preventing this. [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMreatWOKds) [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoIssIS4IDQ) [Report](https://github.com/tswapnil/Resume/blob/master/Attention_Seeking_Robot_Report.pdf) [Code](https://github.com/tswapnil/PC-controlled-Sphero) Java, Android, Arduino 
 
- **Branch Predictor – Computer Architecture**
  Created a Tournament Predictor with competing perceptron and local predictors. C  Impact: Achieved 96% prediction accuracy and secured 7th rank among 130 in the class. 
 
- **Portability Analysis, Text to image Synthesis using GANs**
  Used a GAN model to generate artificial flower images from Flower Dataset & number images from MNIST & hand-crafted Dataset – Python, Tensorflow . Tested our hypothesis that GAN is generalizable and portable to other datasets. [Report](https://github.com/tswapnil/Resume/blob/master/text-image-synthesis.pdf) 
 
- **Improving Recall using features of CNN**
  Improved Recall of image similarity search using internal representations of CNNs-Python, Matlab. [Survey](https://github.com/tswapnil/Resume/blob/master/survey-improving-recall%20.pdf) 
  Impact: Improved the average recall from 0.56 to 0.79 using CNN features. 
 
- **XQuery Processor**
  Created and optimized XQuery Processor for executing Xpath 2.0 expressions. – Antlr 4, Java, XML [Link](https://github.com/tswapnil/XQuery-Processor)
 
- **Generating Music using RNNs, Transfer Learning using VGG16 – CNN**
  Generated melodious music on an RNN model trained on text in ABC notation-Python [Report](https://github.com/tswapnil/Resume/blob/master/generating%20music.pdf) 
  Trained just the last softmax layer on Caltech 256 and utilized the existing VGG16 model parameters. [Report](https://github.com/tswapnil/Resume/blob/master/transfer%20learning%20vgg16.pdf)
 
- **Android Applications**
  Created the following Android apps and optimized the speed of background tasks making the interface more User friendly and Interactive. 
  - Weather App: to display weather forecast for preferred location using Udacity API [Link](https://github.com/tswapnil/TheSunApp)
  - Hydration Reminder: to promote timely drinking of water by notifying user every 30 min. while charging. [Link](https://github.com/tswapnil/HydrationReminderApp)   
  - Music Visualizer: to display the higher, middle and lower range of frequencies of a song. [Link](https://github.com/tswapnil/VisualizerApp) 
 
- **Designing & Building Humanoid Robot (Bachelor’s Thesis)**                                                        
  Built a humanoid robot having – Locomotion on Wheels, Hand Shake and Face Tracking –DC Motors (wheels) and Servo Motors (face). Haar Cascade Classifiers (Open CV), Arduino Uno – Atmega 16 AVR.  [Report](https://github.com/tswapnil/BTech-Project/blob/master/Final_Report_BTP.pdf)  [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnBkGbj87uc)
  Impact: Achieved a 95% facial distinction while ensuring security of the lab. 
 
- **One Eyed Robot, Tech Fest Shristi**
  Implemented facial recognition for passersby on a Webcam mounted on two servo motors tracking the face of human. Used OpenCV and Arduino Uno for controlled motion of webcam in the 3 degrees of freedom.
